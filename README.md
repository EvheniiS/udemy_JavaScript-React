# Course Homework Repository

Welcome to my homework repository for the programming course! This repository contains all the assignments and projects I have completed throughout the course. Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or module, showcasing my learning journey and the skills I have acquired.

## About the Movies Project

The **Movies** project is a personal movie database application that allows users to manage their movie-watching experience. In this project, I focused on practical tasks such as:

- Implementing user input for movie titles and ratings.
- Creating a database to store and retrieve user data.
- Developing functions to analyze viewing habits and preferences.

This project showcases my skills in JavaScript and object-oriented programming.
